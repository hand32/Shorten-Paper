This is "A Night of Counting the Stars," a poem by Yun Dong-ju from his 1948 collection "Sky, Wind, Stars, and Poetry." The autumn sky is full, and the speaker feels carefree enough to count all the stars. But he can't finish because morning comes too soon, tomorrow's night is still ahead, and he still has the fire of youth. Each star holds a memory, love, loneliness, longing, poetry, or thoughts of his mother. He calls out names of poets and people he misses, including his mother who is far away. He writes his own name on a hill bright with starlight, but covers it up with dirt. Insects lament their shameful names, but when spring comes, shrubs will grow thick on the hill, like grass on a grave.
